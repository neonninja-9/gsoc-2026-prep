# GSoC 2026 – Organization Shortlist (based on my profile)

This shortlist is built from **past GSoC mentoring organizations** and filtered based on my profile:

* **Languages:** C++ (strongest) > Python > JavaScript > Java
* **Interests:** Competitive Programming / DSA > Software Engineering > Open Source Career Growth
* **Tools I use:** Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/Mint/Kali), Git, Docker/Kubernetes, databases (MySQL/Postgres), browsers

---

## How I will use this shortlist

* **Primary targets (Tier A):** pick 3–5 and focus deeply
* **Secondary targets (Tier B):** keep as backup orgs
* For each org, I will:

  1. read ideas list
  2. clone repo + build locally
  3. solve starter issue
  4. contact mentor with proof of work
