## Wikimedia Foundation Overview

The **Wikimedia Foundation** is the nonprofit organization that supports and operates a global network of free knowledge projects, most famously **Wikipedia**, along with **Wikidata**, **Wikimedia Commons**, **Wiktionary**, and many others. These projects are built and maintained by a large community of volunteer editors, developers, and translators around the world with the shared mission of making knowledge freely accessible to everyone. Wikimedia projects uphold values of openness, collaboration, and free licensing, enabling contributors from any background to participate. ([Wikimedia Foundation][1])

At the heart of Wikimedia’s technical ecosystem is **MediaWiki**, the free and open-source software platform that powers Wikipedia and related sites. MediaWiki is extensible, multilingual, and designed to handle very large communities and datasets, making it a rich environment for contributors who want to dig into real-world open-source engineering. ([MediaWiki][2])

### GSoC 2026 Projects

While the official list of projects for **GSoC 2026** will only be published once Wikimedia’s application is accepted and ideas are finalized, past cycles and planning discussions suggest contributions can span:

* Enhancements to core MediaWiki features and extensions
* Improvements to mobile apps (e.g., Wikimedia Android/iOS apps)
* Tooling for content moderation, search, or data workflows
* Infrastructure projects around Wikimedia Cloud Services
* Localization and internationalization tooling
* User interface and accessibility improvements

These projects often involve collaborations between frontend, backend, and platform components, offering a great chance to build impactful solutions used by millions globally. ([MediaWiki][3])

### Code Management and Communication Platforms

The Wikimedia technical community uses common open-source tools for development and collaboration:

**Version Control & Code Review**

* Code is hosted on Git repositories (for example, the **MediaWiki** core repo on GitHub).
* For review workflows, Wikimedia historically uses **Gerrit** alongside Git, enabling structured code review and contribution management. ([MediaWiki][2])

**Community & Communication**

* Contributors coordinate via mailing lists, **Phabricator** (task tracker), and chat platforms (such as IRC/Matrix channels linked from project documentation).
* Documentation and contributor guidelines are available on mediawiki.org, and mentors encourage early communication in relevant developer forums and lists before submitting proposals. ([MediaWiki][4])

Overall, Wikimedia offers a welcoming and global open-source community where beginning contributors can grow into skilled developers while helping maintain some of the world’s most widely used free knowledge platforms.
