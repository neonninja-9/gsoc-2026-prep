# OpenELIS-Global-2 Overview

## Introduction

OpenELIS-Global-2 is the primary open-source repository of OpenELIS Global, a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to support clinical and public health laboratories at both facility and national levels. The platform is built to automate and streamline laboratory workflows, improve data accuracy, and enhance interoperability with other health information systems.

OpenELIS Global aims to provide enterprise-grade laboratory information systems that are accessible, configurable, and scalable—particularly for low- and middle-income countries. By strengthening laboratory data management, the project contributes directly to improved healthcare delivery and public health outcomes worldwide.
