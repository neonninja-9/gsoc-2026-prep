# GSoC 2026 Preparation (gsoc-2026-prep)

This repository documents my structured preparation for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026**.

The main purpose of this repo is to keep my work organized and transparent, including:
- mentoring org research
- project idea exploration
- proposal drafts
- weekly progress logs
- open-source contribution milestones

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build consistent open-source contribution habits
- Understand OSS community workflows (issues → PRs → review → merge)
- Identify 1–2 GSoC orgs and project ideas that match my skills and interests
- Write a strong GSoC proposal with clear milestones and deliverables
